Welcome to Computer Vision Course repository! Here you will find the sources and notes of the lab classes. This course has the lab classes, homework and implementation assigments based on [openCV](https://opencv.org/) and [open3D](http://www.open3d.org/docs/release/#) and using python (be careful since open3D currently only support python 3.7 to 3.10). This  repository organizes the material used in the lab classes.
